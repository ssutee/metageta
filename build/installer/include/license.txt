                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, ""this License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the ""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  ""The Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An ""Application"" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A ""Combined Work"" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the ""Linked
Version"".

  The ""Minimal Corresponding Source"" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License ""or any later version""
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

Appendix J. MySQL FLOSS License Exception

Version 0.3, 10 February 2005

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software-only Applications Using MySQL 
Client Libraries (the ``FLOSS Exception'').

Exception Intent
We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'') applications to be able to 
use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not 
all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the ``GPL'').

Legal Terms and Conditions
As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the GPL:

    1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Program and 
    one or more works (each, a ``FLOSS Work'') licensed under one or more of the licenses listed 
    below in section 1, as long as:

        1. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the Derivative Work, except for 
        identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, 
        and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves,

        2. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the 
        Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in 
        themselves,
            * i  are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
            * ii the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the 
            complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same 
            medium and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or 
            executable forms of those sections, and
        3. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative Work on a volume 
        of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be 
        considered independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of 
        either the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.

    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, 
    distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing 
    option from MySQL AB.

      Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that any version 
      follow the 2003 version of the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition 
      (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of the Open Source Definition 
      by the Open Source Initiative (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).
 
    3. Definitions
        1. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
        2. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.

    4. Applicability This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain a notice placed 
    by MySQL AB saying that the Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS 
    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a Derivative Work of both the 
    Program and any other work licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not 
    available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work 
    and comply with the GPL in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may 
    choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the terms of the GPL by 
    removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy 
    has never been modified by you or any third party.

# PROJ.4
#=====================================================================
All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are 
available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
was ""public domain"" as is common with US government work, but apparently
this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing 
everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
they wish, including making proprietary derivatives. 

Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.

# SQLITE
#=====================================================================
SQLite Copyright

SQLite is in the Public Domain

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. 
All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits 
dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits 
are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish,
use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a 
compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite 
library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the 
documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. 
The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and 
build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite 
library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken 
from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its 
original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the 
SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,

only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which 
such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a 
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works 
thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You meet the following conditions:

   1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
   License; and

   2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed 
   the files; and

   3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all 
   copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

   4. If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any

   notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
   any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE 
   text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated 
   by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
   contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
   License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You 
   distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that 
   such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or 
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, 
and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the

limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 
exercise of permissions under this License.

negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for 
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work 
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has 
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, 
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
